# Nixie Clock

Nixie Clock is a clock inspired by DIY Nixie tube clocks sprinkled with a retro style VFD (Vacuum Fluorescent Display) lower section for information display.
See a [live demo](https://csabaconsulting.github.io/flutter_clock) with Flutter for Web (best viewed with Chrome, Firefox has horizontal sizing differences in the NixieTube)!
